      <h1>Parent Handbook</h1>
      <br />
      <h2>
        The WUNS Parent Handbook provides families with important information
        about WUNS’ preschool philosophy, staff, curriculum, classrooms,
        events, and policies and procedures. It also includes information on discipline, student transitions,
        intelligence assessments, and parent communication.

      <h2>Communication:</h2>
      <p>
        Communication	is	ongoing	throughout	the	year.		Newsletters,	the	school	website	and	emails	
give	you	information	on	current	themes,	activities	and	upcoming	events.		Phone	calls	and/or	
emails	by	classroom	teachers	to	discuss	your	child’s	adjustment,	observations	and/or	
concerns	are	common.		If	you	feel	you	need	to	speak	to	a	teacher	or	the	director,	please	email	
or	call	the	office.		Teachers	can	be	reached	by	phone	or	email	after	the	school	day	is	over.	
      </p>
        <br /><br />

        <h2>Discipline:</h2>
        <p>
          The	staff	and	director	at	WUNS	work	to	maintain	a	very	positive	and	nurturing	environment	
for	each	child.		Classroom	limits	are	necessary	to	provide	a	sense	of	order	and	allow	teachers	
to	spend	as	much	time	as	possible	providing	a	stimulating	environment	for	each	child.		Our	
rule	of	thumb	is	that	children	keep	themselves	safe,	keep	friends	safe,	and	the	toys	at	school	
safe.	
<br /> <br />
The	staff	is	trained	to	anticipate	potentially	problematic	situations;	they	remind	children	of	
appropriate	behavior	and	redirect	or	intervene	when	necessary.		In	most	cases,	teachers	can	
stop	or	re-direct	behavior	before	something	negative	occurs.		If	not,	teachers	will	first	consult	
the	injured	party	to	make	sure	they	are	emotionally	and	physically	okay.		Then,	they	will	turn	
their	attention	to	the	child	who	might	need	more	support	in	“keeping	their	friends	safe”	or,	
more	likely,	“keeping	their	bodies	safe”	with	others.		Reflection	over	what	has	occurred	will	
lead	to	discovering	other	behavior	options	and	resolving	things	with	the	peer.
<br /> <br />
Encouragement	and	pride	in	self	is	the	basis	of	our	discipline	policy.	Our	aim	is	to	have	the	
children	manage	their	own	actions	and	reactions.	The	teachers	and	staff	will	help	children	
learn	and	develop	skills	that	they	need	to	display	appropriate	behavior.			This	is	done	
through:
<br /> <br />
• Positive	reinforcement. <br />
• Anticipating	unhealthy	social	interaction. <br />
• Re-direction:		guiding	a	child	toward	appropriate,	socially	positive	activities. <br />
• Naming	and	validating	child’s	feelings <br />
• Expressing	disappointment	or	disapproval	in a	respectful	and	constructive	manner.<br />
• Simple,	logical	and	immediate	consequences.<br />
<br />
When	inappropriate	behavior	is	a	continuing	problem, the	school	will	work	with	parents	to	
understand	the	issue	and	make	appropriate	recommendations.		It	is	our	goal	to	make	school	
a	positive,	rewarding	and	enjoyable	experience	for	each	child.		We	realize, however,	that	we	
cannot	meet	the	needs	of	all	children	and	parents.		If	it	is	determined	that	a	child	is	not	
growing	from	his/her	preschool	experience	at	the	Nursery	School, a	discussion	will	be	held	
with	parents	at	which	it	may	be	decided	that	this	program	is	not	appropriate	for	the	child.		
The	director	and	teachers	will	make	recommendations	of	other	preschool	programs	and	
relevant	community	services	if	parents	so	desire.	
        </p>
          <br /><br />
          <h2>Parent/Teacher Conferences</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        Assessment	is	an	ongoing	process	at	WUNS.	Teachers	interact	with	children	in	their	play,	
        conversations	and	observations	both	in	the	classrooms	and	during	outdoor	play.	Teachers	
        keep	notes	on	each	child,	writing	about	strengths	and	weaknesses	in	all	areas	of	their	
        development.	Assessment	includes	checklists,	timelines	and	examples	of	the	children’s	
        writings	and	pictures.	Teaching	teams	meet	weekly	to	discuss	each	child	and	plan	activities	
        in	their	program	to	enhance	needed	skills	for	children.	<br /> <br />
        The	school	has	two	Parent	Conferences	during	the	school	year.	The	fall	conference	is	an
        informal,	getting-to-know-the-child-and-family	discussion.	The	spring	conference	includes a	
        more	detailed,	written	assessment.	A	parent-teacher	conference	can	be	scheduled	at	any	
        time	during	the	year	as	needed	and	by	request	of	parents	and/or	teachers.
      </p>
      <br /> <br />

      <h2>Orientation/Transition:</h2>
      <p>
        This	visiting	day	is	usually	the	day	after	Labor	Day	and	gives	the	child	and	parent(s) an	
opportunity	to	visit	the	classroom	and	meet	the	teachers	and	classmates.		This	visit	is	one	
hour.		It	will	allow	time	for	the	child	to	enjoy	free	play	and	also	gives	parent(s) a	brief	
overview	of what	to	expect	during	the	school	year. <br /><br />
The	next	day, a	child	will	attend school on	his/her own	(either	Wednesday	or	Thursday,	see	
orientation	schedule).		The	class	is	divided	in	half,	attending	on	either	Wednesday or	
Thursday.		This	schedule	allows	the	children	and	teachers	to	interact	with	a	small	group	
before the	entire	class	attends	on	Friday.
