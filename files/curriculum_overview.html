      <h2>Extra Help:</h2>
      <p>
        The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and assess children’s progress on
an ongoing basis. Teachers consistently plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to
meet students’ needs. <br /><br />
If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety
of ways, which may include: <br />
• Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking
process, build trust, and increase student confidence <br />
• Offering more opportunities for exploration <br />
• Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli <br />
• Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration <br />
• Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in
order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process <br />
• Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular
concept, skill, or area of concern <br /><br />

<h2>Math:</h2>
<p>
  Math skills are being formed while children play. These activities involve: <br />
• Identifying shapes, sizes, patterns, and sequences <br />
• Sorting and categorizing into sets <br />
• Counting and comparison, one-to-one correspondence <br />
• Measuring length and weight <br />
• Using numbers (as symbols and to represent quantity) <br />
• Graphing <br /><br />

<h2>Language:</h2>
<p>
  Language development is enhanced through: <br />
• Verbally communicating and listening to others <br />
• Dramatic play <br />
• Listening to and telling stories <br />
• Listening to music and singing songs <br />
• Beginning to identify meaningful words – own name, friends’ names, calendar words, job
chart, etc. <br />
• Dictating, drawing, and writing stories, and creating books of the child’s own making <br /><br />

<h2>Science:</h2>
<p>
  Science concepts are developed by: <br />
• Observing seasonal changes related to weather, plant life, animal behavior and activities
of people/families <br />
• Sorting and categorizing items according to various properties <br />
• Observing and/or collecting plants, animals, and insects in their environment <br />
• Learning basic conservation of and respect for nature, as well as concept and practice of
recycling materials and goods <br />
• Growing plants from seeds and bulbs, observing stages of growth and parts of plants <br />
• Exploring animals through hatching chicken eggs, butterflies, tadpoles, and more
• Discovering how magnets work <br />
• Observing changes in matter through experiments with heat and cold <br />
• Cooking and eating healthy snacks <br /><br />
